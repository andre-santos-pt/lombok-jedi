 * 
 * This annotation is used in conjunction with &#64;FlyweightObject to support
 * the implementation of the Flyweight Pattern.
 * This annotation also turns the object into a value object, by overriding the equals and hashcode method.
 * The class annotated with it, will generate the following:
 *<p><ul>
 *<li>a private constructor with the fields annotated with  &#64;FlyweightObject as arguments.
 *<li>a getMethod for each of the fields annotated with  &#64;FlyweightObject.
 *<li>an overrided hashcode and equals for value Object.
 *<li>a getInstance method that returns the Flyweight if exists, otherwise creates it, and then returns it( depends on the method type).
 *</ul>
 * Validations:
 * <p><ul>
 * <li>Class will not be able to contain public constructors.
 * <li>Can not be used on Interfaces and abstract classes.
 * <li>Need to contain at least one  &#64;FlyweightObject
 * </ul><p>
